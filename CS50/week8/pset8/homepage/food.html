        <h3>Bacareto da Lele</h3>
        <p>If you arrive from Piazzale Roma a break in this &#39;bacaro&#39; is a must for those who love bacari.</p>
        <p>It is placed in a corner of &#39;Campo dei Tolentini&#39;, this tiny tavern is well known by its delicious sandwiches, its affordale price and by the owner&#39;s simpath, Mr. Fabio, who serves &#39;ombre&#39; (glasses of wine) without stop. You should taste the sandwiches with ham, salami, cheese, pork with artichokes, with or without mustard and so on...</p>
        <p>This tavern, along the day, it is frequented by a wide rage of customers: workers, retired people, students of professors who teach in the faculty of achitecture nearby , all are attracted by this special corner of Venice where is a pleasure listen to the true jokes of the local people. This &#39;bacareto&#39; is also a meeting point for many goup of friends who, once gained their booty, go to the near &#39;fondamenta&#39; or on the stairs of the &#39;Tolentini church&#39; during the summer time.</p>
        <p>Just one thing to keep in mind: no toielet avaible and there are not seats.</p>

        <h3>Al Squero</h3>
        <p>This &#39;Bacaro&#39; is really fascinating. It is placed just in front of one of the last &#39;squeri&#39; (shipyard) and thanks to its strategial position it can offer a great view on the &#39;gondole&#39; under construction.</p>

        <p>It is tiny but friendly, there are some seats inside, the price are clear and the counter desk is always full of specialities: sandwiches, special bread with herring, butter with onion or tune and caramelized onion, truffle pat√® with ham or creamy cheese, read radish with walnuts and much more.</p>

        <p>But you can find find the classic &#39;cicheti&#39; as &#39;sarde in saor&#39; or codfish with butter or stuffed as in a typical recipe that comes from Vicenza or you can also taste snapper in butter.</p>

        <p>During the sunny days it is a pleasure taking a plate with some appetizers and go ousite near the external wall along the canal ad eat there in the open air. Just one thing to keep in mind: beware of the seagulls!</p>
